# Online-Bank-Application
It is an Online Bank Application developed with Java programming, Hibernate Framework for the backend, and HTML and CSS for the Frontend, and here I used SQL for data storing in the database. In the bank application, they have so many options, like deposits, credits, transaction histories, etc.
